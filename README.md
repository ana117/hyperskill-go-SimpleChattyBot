# Simple Chatty Bot
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Go and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

## Stages
**Stage 1/5: Chatty Bot welcomes you**\
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.

**Stage 2/5: Print your name**\
Introduce yourself to the bot.

**Stage 3/5: Guess the age**\
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.

**Stage 4/5: Learning numbers**\
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a for loop at this stage!

**Stage 5/5: Multiple choice**\
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
